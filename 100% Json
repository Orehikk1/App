        "content": "**1.0 Let’s start with a common question! Where do Hungarians come from?**\n\nThe Hungarians are often confused with the ancient Hun people, but the two peoples are only related by blood. The ancient tribe of the Hungarians originated from the then Yugra region, which is the present-day Russian steppe and Kazakh/Mongol territory.\n\nThey were considered as Eurasian people and were different in religion from European peoples. They believed in several gods and their religious leaders were shamans. They were a warrior people and were not very different from the Vikings, which means they were pagans in the eyes of the Europeans. During their long migrations, they mixed with many peoples, mainly Turkic peoples.\n\n[IMAGE:hungarian_migration]\n\n**1.0.1 The Hungarian Language**\n\nTThe Hungarian language belongs to the Uralic language family and can be classified as a Finno-Ugric language. Since the country was under different powers for centuries throughout history, the language has changed a lot from the original and has become even more complex. Nowadays, Hungarian also contains words from Turkish, German and Slavic languages. There are some grammatical rules like the Turkish language, but we can thank this for the 150 years of occupation.\n\n**1.4 Hungary's Annexations**\n\nHungary is not in a very fortunate place due to its geographical location. In the middle of Europe, the country has often fallen victim to larger empires. First, in the 16th century, the Turks ruled over the Hungarians for 150 years, then the Habsburg for almost 200 years. In World War II, the Germans invaded the country. After that, in 1947, our country belonged to the Soviet Union for more than 40 years. The Hungarians tried to free themselves from slavery three times, but without success.\n\n**The Flag during the Austrian Occupation**\n\n[IMAGE:flag_austria]\n\n**The Flag during the Soviet Union times**\n\n[IMAGE:flag_soviet]\n\n**The Árpád King Family first Flag**\n\n[IMAGE:flag_arpad]\n\n**1.4.1 The Revolutions**\n\n Hungary, we distinguish three major wars of independence.\n\nThe first is the Rákóczi-style war of independence. (1703-1710)\n\nFerenс Rákóczi rebelled against the Habsburg’s and tried to prevent Hungary from falling into Austrian hands. At first, he wanted to make peace with the Habsburg kings and Transylvania would have been recognised as a permanent separate principality. But before the compromise, he turned against them and fought against the Austrians. His battles were extremely successful. But financially he could not last long alone. Since the Spanish and Austrian branches of the Habsburg were at war over the inheritance. Rákóczi could easily travel around the country proclaiming the revolution. However, the fighting could not continue because the English and French kings no longer supported Ferenc. Later, Rákóczi died in Turkey.\n\nOur second great revolution was also against the Austrians in 1848-49.\n\nThe country rebelled against oppression. The main reasons for the people were that the Hungarian culture, people, trade and language were also oppressed. Hungarian soldiers were always sent to station abroad, while in the country the Austrian soldiers kept the people in terror. In 1848 the revolution started from the capital and demanded 12 points from the Habsburg leaders. The Hungarian soldiers were ordered home and in the first year of the freedom struggle the Austrian army was expelled from the country. Unfortunately, in 1849 the Habsburg King Franz Joseph called on the Russian Tsar for help and the freedom fighters were crushed from both sides. In retaliation, all 12 of our generals and 1 colonel were executed.\n\nOur third and final revolution was in 1956\n\nThe Soviet Union's oppression was a huge burden on the Hungarian people. The forced industrialisation and centralised trade took a lot of money from the people. The people became so impoverished that it was a miracle if a family could eat bread every day. In 1956, Polish riots broke out against the Soviet Union and the Hungarian Brotherhood took solidarity with them. Hungarian university students organised peaceful demonstrations and demanded the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country. The demonstrations on October 23rd were peaceful until the evening when the young people wanted to have the 12 points read. The ÁVH then took the university students' representatives prisoner on the radio and did not want to release them. The crowd outside then rioted and wanted to break into the radio. This led to the secret political police (ÁVH) shooting into the crowd, starting the revolution. In the following days, young people took up arms and began to drag away ÁVH members and hang or beat them. As a result, Soviet troops attacked the insurgents and took up violence not only in Budapest, but throughout the country. Hungarian youth (from the age of 12 to 65) occupied military barracks and took up arms to fight the Soviets. On October 25, the Hungarian Communist Party capitulated to Moscow and the fighting subsided. The demonstrators marched again without weapons to the Parliament and renewed their demand for the fall of the government. Unfortunately, the secret police demanded revenge and fired into the crowd from the buildings surrounding the Parliament. Thousands of people died that day, and it is remembered as BLOODY THURSDAY. After the protesters continued to fight, the Soviets were temporarily forced to withdraw their troops from Hungary. But a few days later, on October 30, they sent back a larger force. About 2,000 tanks and 30,000 soldiers. But let's be clear about the numbers: Hitler also needed 2,000 tanks to occupy Belgium, the Netherlands and half of France. The 20,000 Hungarian wounded were eventually sentenced to prison or death. The next time it was allowed to talk about this was during the change of regime in 1989.The cut-out Soviet flag that became a symbol of the revolutionn\n\n**The cut-out Soviet flag became a symbol of the revolution**\n\n[IMAGE:revolution_soviet_flag]\n\n**3.1 Hungary During the Second World War**\n\nIn World War II, Hungary fought alongside Germany to regain territory lost due to the unjustly concluded World War I peace treaties. Since the war did not go well economically for the Hungarian army, they wanted to stop after regaining Northern Transylvania, but Hitler did not allow this.\n\nHungary had to send soldiers against Russia, but there were not enough weapons and ammunition. After the Hungarian armies suffered a serious defeat at the Don in 1943. After that, Miklós Horthy tried several times to get out of the war, but without success. Nazi sympathisers in the country carried out a coup and handed over control to the Germans. The siege of the capital, however, was very bloody. Budapest was the most difficult for the Soviets to capture. The siege of the capital lasted more than 53 days. On average, they managed to capture other large cities in 20-30 days. Of the 53 days, there were more than 13 days of bombing.\n\nThe battle for the city lasted so long because the Hungarian troops tried to take advantage of all the natural features. There is a tunnel system of several kilometres under the castle and they used this to hide from the bombings and here they were able to easily hide the population, who were not so threatened by the carpet bombing.\n\n[IMAGE:ww2_bombed_square]\n\n**The Budapest Ghetto**\n\nUnfortunately, since the Hungarians were on the wrong side in World War II, they not only adopted the war theories, but also the ideology of racial discrimination. In November 1944, Ferenc Szállasi and his Arrow Cross militia took control of the country and played everything into the hands of the Nazis. On November 29, 1944, the Jewish district was established, where the Jews were separated from the community. The ghetto was there from the end of November until January 17, 1945. Even during its short operation, thousands of Jews died here. Soviet soldiers liquidated the ghetto area and freed the prisoners. Walking around the area, we can see memorial plaques on almost every corner.\n\n[IMAGE:budapest_ghetto]",

            "content": "[IMAGE:saint_stephen]\n\n**1) Who was Saint Stephen?**\n\nSaint Stephen is the founding king who made Hungary a unified Christian country. His case is special because he personally dealt with the Hungarian pagans and killed his uncle Koppány, who wanted to take the throne from Stephen. The country celebrates the founding of the Christian homeland on August 20th every year with large events.\n\nWe often see statues with two rows of crosses, symbolizing that Hungary was separate from the Papal States and the Holy Roman Empire at that time.\n\n**2) The Basilica**\n\n[IMAGE:basilica]\n\nSt. Stephen's Basilica is the largest church in Budapest. It was named after the king who united the Hungarians in Christianity. Construction started in 1851 and was completed in 1905—a total of 54 years.\n\nAfter Stephen's death, he was canonized, and by order of the Pope, his right hand was mummified as a relic. This hand, called the Holy Right Hand, is kept in the church and taken in a procession every August 20th.\n\n[IMAGE:holy_right_hand]\n\nOn the facade of the building there is a Latin sentence: **EGO SUM VIA VERITAS ET VITA** which means: I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE, this is what Jesus preached to his apostles. The Basilica was also built for the 1000th anniversary, but during its construction it took 4 builders to complete it, because the central dome collapsed three times and unfortunately three of the 4 builders died in the meantime. The only building that has the same height as the Parliament. (96m) Built in Neo-Renaissance style.\n\n**3) Liberty Square**\n\n[IMAGE:liberty_square]\n\nLiberty Square is not an ordinary square. Before it became a children's playground, in the 1850s there was a huge prison there, the largest in the city. The soldiers, poets and revolutionaries of the 1848-49 War of Independence were held in this prison. This did not last long, because in 1867 Austria and Hungary entered a personal union and the Hungarian Minister could decide on some things in domestic policy issues.\n\nOur Minister decided to dismantle the prison from the city centre and all revolutionaries were released.\n\n[IMAGE:old_prison]\n\nStock Exchange Palace\n\n[IMAGE:stock_exchange]\n\nThis building was constructed in 1902 as the Stock Exchange Palace but stopped functioning as such after World War II, when Hungary fell under Soviet control.\n\nIt was later used as the National Television Headquarters until 2006, when a political riot led to protesters storming the building and causing damage. Since then, it has remained empty, only occasionally used for film productions (e.g., Black Widow). Built in Late Eclecticism style.\n\n**4) The German Occupation Monument**\n\n[IMAGE:german_monument]\n\nUnfortunately, this monument is not exactly the most popular, because what is written on it has caused a lot of political debate and disagreement among people. The text that is written there is: IN MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION.  Many people believe that this statement is a history falsification, because the Hungarian people were the first to happily join Nazi Germany.\n\n[IMAGE:soviet_monument]\n\n**5) Another unpopular monument, as the inscription states:**\n\n\"GLORY TO THE SOVIET SOLDIERS WHO LIBERATED HUNGARY.\"\n\nHowever, many Hungarians view Soviet rule as oppression rather than liberation.\n\nNearby, you can also find statues of two former US presidents: Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.\n\n**6) The Parliament**\n\n[IMAGE:parliament]\n\nThe Budapest Parliament was the main building built for the 1000th anniversary. All the materials, even the last piece of stone, came from Hungary, and the builders could only be Hungarians. That's why we call this building the country's house.\n\nThere is a rule in the city centre that states that there can be no building larger than the parliament. This is the reason why you don't see skyscrapers in the inner city.The height of the Parliament is 96 meters and only the Basilica reaches the same height, because it bears the name of St. Stephen.In Europe, this Parliament is only the third largest in terms of size, the second largest parliament in our country is the Westminster in London, and the largest is the Romanian Parliament in Bucharest.\n\nIn total, there are 691 rooms. The main architect Imre Steindl, hungarian architect, became blind in the middle of the construstion work, but still continued his job. The Parliament was finished in 1902, but Imre Steindl passed away two weeks before this date. Officially, it started operating in 1904.Built in neo-gothic, eclectic style.\n\n**7) The Flags at the Entrance**\n\n[IMAGE:flags_parliament]\n\nThe flag on the left is the flag of Transylvania, it is there because until the First World War, Transylvania belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary for more than a thousand years. It is important to note that the Hungarians did not want to participate in the First World War, but since this did not depend on us but on the Austrian emperor, we did not have much choice. At the end of the war, Hungary received the greatest punishment, because the victorious countries decided to take 70% of its territories from Hungary. Partly because in terms of area and not in terms of population, there were more Romanians, Slovaks, Serbs, Austrians living in those territories than Hungarians.\n\nDue to the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary lost more than 8 million Hungarians to Russia. After all this, the Hungarians living in the ceded territories were kept in terror if they wanted to use the Hungarian language or culture.\n\nStatues and Monuments at Parliament\n\nAll the statues in front of the parliament were made between the 17th century and the 19th century.\n\n**8) Statue of II. Ferenc Rákóczi**\n\n[IMAGE:rakoczi_statue]\n\nFerenc Rákóczi was the leader of the Kuruc Labanc freedom struggle. Ferenc tried to prevent the Austrian takeover. During the wars, he had many successes, but he needed more soldiers and money. He went to the French King for help, but he betrayed him and handed Ferenc over to the Habsburgs. He had to live his life in exile and died in Turkey.\n\n**9) Count Gyula Andrássy**\n\n[IMAGE:andrassy_statue]\n\nAGyula fought in the 1848-49 War of Independence but was imprisoned when the country fell. 15 years later he got mercy from the Austrian Emperor and became Prime Minister of Hungary when the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy was established.\n\n**10) Lajos Kossuth and His Political Party**\n\n[IMAGE:kossuth_statue]\n\nALajos Kossuth was a major leader during the 1848-49 War of Independence. After the fall of the homeland, he emigrated to America and continued his military career there during the civil wars. The statue was built after his death. Every Hungarian respected him and revolutionary songs about him are still taught in schools today.\n\n**11) Statue of István Tisza**\n\n[IMAGE:tisza_statue]\n\nHIstván Tisza was the Prime Minister of Hungary during World War I. He protested the Great War, but his efforts were in vain as the final decision was made by the Austrian Emperor. At the end of the war, some communist-sympathizing soldiers attacked him in his own house and executed him because he was blamed for the large territorial losses.\n\n**12) The Palace of Justice**\n\n[IMAGE:palace_justice]\n\nThis building was built in 1893 and its builders hoped that this building would become the parliament. Since we would have two parliaments, the members of the Hungarian architectural committee started a vote to decide which one should be the parliament. Before they voted, they inspected the building, and the members of the Hungarian committee found a flaw in the building. The builder of the building was Austrian and therefore it could not be a parliament, but the Palace of Justice. Built in eclectic style.\n\n**13) Ministry of Agriculture (in front of parliament)**\n\n[IMAGE:agricultura]\n\nIn Soviet times, it was the headquarters of the Communist political party. It was from this building that members of the secret political police (ÁVH) fired on a peaceful protesting crowd in 1956.\n\n**14) River Bank Shoes (Holocaust Memorial)**\n\n[IMAGE:river_shoes]\n\nIron Shoes on the Danube Bank is a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. In 1944, the German and Hungarian forces were clearly losing. As the Nazis reached the Hungarian borders, they shot up all the railway lines that went in and out of the country.\n\nThis meant that the transport of people of Jewish origin to the concentration camp became impossible\n\nSince the Hungarian Arrow Cross militia had to make a quick decision, they decided to carry out the executions on the embankment. Since this is a rather difficult topic, we will not go into more detailed information, but it should be clarified that during the Holocaust, not only Jews were executed, but also Gypsies and gays. The Arrow Cross used particularly cruel methods during the executions. Sometimes, citing the need to save ammunition, they would shoot one person from a family, but their feet would be tied together with the rest of the family. A total of 60 pairs of shoes can be seen there, as the monument was unveiled on the 60th anniversary of the events.\n\n**15) The Budapest Synagogue**\n\n[IMAGE:synagogue]\n\nThis synagogue was completed in 1859. Interestingly, it was the fastest built of all the attractions in Budapest. Despite its size, the building was completed in 5 years. Many Jews still live around the synagogue today and preserve the traditions of their religion. This synagogue is the largest synagogue in Europe.\n\nIn the spring of 1931, two worshippers were killed by a revolver-wielding assassin, and on February 3, 1939, a hand grenade was thrown from the roof of the house opposite into the crowd leaving the service. Finally, in 1944, the Budapest ghetto was established here: one of its gates was on the Wesselényi Street side of the arcade. Nearly seventy thousand people were crowded together,in the blocks of houses behind it and in the synagogue itself, deprived of their property and rights, and subjected to constant fear of death.",

        "content": "**The Liberty statue**\n\nThe Statue of Liberty itself was placed on top of Gellért Hill after 1947 to commemorate the **liberating Soviet soldiers and the freedom given by the glorious Soviet Union**. There were statues there before, for example the statue of Miklós Horthy's son who died a heroic death in World War II. The symbol of the statue is freedom itself, and the lady is holding a palm leaf in the air. The lady who was modelled after the Statue of Liberty was an ordinary Budapest resident.\n\nThe sculptor, while walking down the street, saw a woman with a beautiful face. Noticing her beauty, the sculptor immediately asked the young woman to be his model for the statue. Since we are initially talking about a Soviet monument, until 1956, statues of Soviet soldiers with PPS-41 submachine guns stood in front of the statue. Since in 1956 the Hungarians started a revolution against the Soviet Union, the angry crowd overthrew the soldiers from their positions, after fights and demonstrations, they were transported to Memento Park, where they can still be seen today.\n\n[IMAGE:citadelm]\n\n**The Citadel**\n\nThis fortress was built in 1854 by the famous General Haynau at the request of Franz Joseph to intimidate the city's inhabitants and the nation. We should know that in 1848-49 the country launched a revolution against the Austrians, but despite the Hungarian military successes, the Hungarians unfortunately lost the war of independence, because the Habsburg king called on the Russian Tsarist army for help. The building itself does not hold a good memory for the Hungarians, but its historical significance is essential.  During World War II, the fortress was used as an air defence base. After the war, it also functioned as a hotel and entertainment venue, and unfortunately, several drunk people fell from the hilltop. It operated until 2014, and has been abandoned ever since. Now it is being renovated again and can once again function as a hotel.\n\n[IMAGE:citadel1]",

The bridge was modern and unique at the time, as it was one of the first **suspension bridges** in the world.\n\nIt was named after **Queen Elisabeth (Sissi)** because it was completed shortly after her death, and they wanted to commemorate her in this way.\n\nThe original structure was **blown up** in **World War II (1944)** by **Nazi soldiers** for strategic reasons. It was never rebuilt in its original form, as the Soviet Union did not allow **Royalist structures** to be restored.\n\nThe current bridge was opened in **1964**, but it is much simpler than its old form.\n\n[IMAGE:elisabeth_bridge]\n\n**1.2) Gellért Statue**\n\nTo understand the story of **Gellért**, we need to know about the **origin of the Hungarians**. (See topic **1.0**) Gellért was the **main archbishop** of Hungary who died a **martyr’s death** in the **11th century**.\n\nAfter the death of **Saint Stephen**, a **royal conflict** arose. The remaining **pagan Hungarians** attempted an uprising to seize power. Gellért was captured in a surprise attack. He was **dragged to the top of the hill** and **thrown down in a nailed barrel**.\n\nThe hill was later named after **Gellért**, and his statue commemorates his martyrdom. Built in **1904**, the statue serves as an apology, since today **more than 70% of Hungarians** are **Christians**.\n\nBelow the statue, a **kneeling Hungarian** represents asking for forgiveness. The **columns behind Gellért** symbolize the **nailed barrel**, and in summer, an **artificial waterfall** represents the way he was killed.\n\n[IMAGE:gellert_statue]\n\n**1.3) The Castle Garden Bazaar**\n\nBuilt at the **end of the 19th century**, the Castle Garden Bazaar aimed to **connect trade routes** between Buda and Pest.\n\nSeverely **damaged in World War II**, part of its original design was lost. During the **Soviet era**, it became a **youth park**, later used for **concerts**. Today, it remains an **exhibition center** and a **summer garden**.\n\nRestored in **2014**, its **middle section** reflects Hungary’s history. The **two domes** are in **Ottoman Turkish style**, symbolizing **150 years of Turkish occupation**. A **female statue holding a sickle** commemorates **40 years of Soviet rule**.\n\nBuilt in **Neo-Renaissance** style.\n\nThe lions also hold a typical Austrian symbol. It's interesting that if you visit Hungary or Austria, you will see at least one lion statue at every major attraction.\n\nBuilding style is: Neo-Renaissance\n\n[IMAGE:castle_garden_bazaar]\n\n**1.4) The Buda Castle** was built around 1245. Unfortunately, in 1241 the Hungarians were attacked by the Mongols, and this is called the Tatar invasion. The Tatars easily defeated the Hungarian armies and thanks to this they quickly went around the country, burning all the important fortresses, cities and castles. This could have happened because at that time most of the buildings in the country were still built of wood and were old fortresses. Béla IV, who we call the Hungarians the Second Founder, made the decision after the Tatars' withdrawal that all the defence points and cities should be rebuilt in stone. Thus, Buda became one of the most important strategic points of the country and thus became the first capital of Hungary.\n\nThe first unofficial capital was Székesfehérvár, because the royal family settled there. What may be interesting is that before World War II, this castle was the second most powerful castle in Central Europe. Unfortunately, the castle was damaged to such an extent during the war that its current appearance is nowhere near what it was before. It resembles its old form by about 30%. Today, the castle houses the Hungarian National Gallery and the Budapest History Museum. It no longer serves as a royal castle, as after World War I, we were separated from the Austrian Empire and there had been no Hungarian king or prince for centuries. Building style : Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque.\n\n[IMAGE:buda_castle]\n\n**1.5) The Chain Bridge**\n\nThis bridge is the most iconic bridge in the capital, as it was the first permanent bridge that connected Buda and Pest, built in 1850. This structure was the reason why we no longer mention the two cities separately, but together. However, there was initially no agreement on how to name the city, as there were people who called the city PestBuda and there were those who called it Budapest. The source of this dispute was that there were more Austrians living on the Buda side and at that time the grievances of the 1848-49 revolution still remained.\n\nThe dispute was concluded by the fact that Óbuda was also added to the two cities, making the Buda side larger in area than the Pest side. Officially, our city has been called Budapest since 1873.There are many legends about the bridge, but one thing is certain: its architects were British William and Adam Clark. It is very interesting that this bridge has an older sibling, also built by the two architects in Marlow.\nOnly public transport is allowed on the bridge (no regular cars), ofcourse police, ambulance and governmental cars are exception.\nDuring the covid bridge was closed for renovation.\n\n[IMAGE:chain_bridge]\n\n[IMAGE:marlow_bridge]\n\n**1.6) The Funicular**\n\nThe **Buda Castle funicular**, built in the **1870s**, provided **fast transportation up the hill** and offered **panoramic views** of the **Chain Bridge and Pest side**.\n\nIt was one of the **first electrically powered funiculars** in the world.\n\n**Destroyed in World War II**, it was **rebuilt in 1986** and is now a **tourist attraction**. A round trip costs **€13**.\n\n[IMAGE:funicular]\n\n**1.7) The 0-Kilometre Stone**\n\nThis stone marks the **official starting point** for measuring distances from **Budapest**.\n\nThe original **0-kilometre stone** stood in front of the **castle steps** until **World War II**, when it was destroyed. The **current stone** was placed in **1975**.\n\n[IMAGE:0_kilometre_stone]\n\n**1.8) The Fisherman’s Bastion**\n\nThe **Fisherman’s Bastion** was built for the **1000th anniversary of Hungary (1896)**.\n\nThe structure features **seven towers**, representing the **seven Magyar tribes** that founded Hungary in **895**.\n\nIt was named after the **fishermen’s guild**, which **defended** this section of the city walls and **financed** part of its construction. Despite being called a **bastion**, it was never used for **defense**.\n\nBuilt in **Neo-Romanesque** style.\n\n[IMAGE:fishermans_bastion]\n\n**1.9) The Matthias Church**\n\nThe Matthias Church or Blessed Virgin Mary Church was built in the 13th century at about the same time as the castle. Officially, it became the coronation church and functioned until 1541, when the Ottomans occupied the city. After the Turks took control, all the churches were converted into mosques, and this functioned as such for 150 years.\n\nAfter we managed to get rid of the Ottomans, we rebuilt it into a church, but there is still a black minaret on the building, reminding us of the Turkish times. The meaning of one Minaret means is that in that church everybody could pray. If there would two Minarets it means only royals could pray there. The roof of the building is now made of porcelain, and if we look at the roof alone, it is three times more expensive than the building itself, because this type of porcelain is rare. It was named after King Matthias, the last independent Hungarian king in the 15th century. After him, unfortunately, Hungary was under the influence of great empires with foreign kings.\n\nANowadays, it can be visited or even rented for any kind of celebrations.Next to the church we can see a statue depicting Saint Stephen. Saint Stephen was the first Christian Hungarian king. Built in Gothic and Neo-Gothic style\n\n[IMAGE:matthias_church]",

It reached its current form around 2020 and has undergone many renovations. The Park also houses the House of Music Museum and the Capital Railway History Museum. The Museum of Fine Arts and the Museum of Graphic Arts are located at Heroes' Square. Behind it is the lake where visitors can go boating in summer and ice skating in winter. However, the biggest attraction of the park is the Széchenyi Bath. This spa is the most famous in the city and we can thank Count István Széchenyi for this, who bought the Turkish bath in the area and turned it into something extraordinary.\n\n**Vajdahunyad Castle**\n\n[IMAGE:Vajd]\n\nThe building was built as a copy of the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Hunyadi family in 1896 for the 1000th anniversary. It should be noted that the building was rebuilt twice. The first building was built of wood due to a tight deadline. In 1899, it was demolished because it was in danger of collapsing. Public opinion protested the demolition, and under pressure, what we call the second building was rebuilt. The second castle was rebuilt in 1908 and has since housed the Hungarian Agricultural Museum. The building was built in Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance-Baroque styles.\n\n**The Opera House**\n\n[IMAGE:Opera]\n\nOpera House the National Opera House was built in 1837. It was the first Hungarian-language theatre where performances were held in Hungarian. Since the Oprea quickly outgrew itself, it was renovated in 1884, giving it its current appearance. To this day, it is the only theatre where opera and ballet performances are performed. The building escaped with minor damage during World War II. This opera house has the third best acoustics in Europe. The main hall has a chandelier made of 3000 kg of bronze.

And there is a piece of Berlins wall.\n\n**Andrássy Avenue**\n\n[IMAGE:Andrassy]\n\nAndrássy Avenue is the main road of Budapest. This main road can also be called the Hungarian Champs-Élysées. The main road is bisected by Oktogon Square. The road connects Deák Ferenc Square and the City Park. It is 2.3 km long. The famous M1 metro runs under the square. Many famous buildings can be found on this road, such as the Opera House, the House of Terror, the Kodály Circle, Heroes' Square and the City Park. Sometimes we call it a luxury shopping street, because there are brand shops like Gucci, LV, etc. etc. Also, on this street embassies of different countries can be found.\n\n**The M1 metro line**\n\n[IMAGE:M1]\n\nMetro line M1(the millennial metro) the first metro line in Budapest, running between the Vörösmarty Square and Mexikói Road stations, and runs for the most part under Andrássy út. When it opened in 1896, it was the first underground railway line in continental Europe. The idea and implementation of the underground railway construction are as old as the birth of the London Underground. Its construction began in 1860, and the first underground railway was put into operation in 1863, however, it was still steam-powered. The Budapest Millennium Underground Railway was opened to the public on 2 May 1896 and continues to operate without major disruptions. Until 1973, the length of the line was 3,700 metres, with 9 underground and 2 surface stops. Trains ran every 2 minutes, and the highest daily passenger count was 34,526. Further development did not continue until the end of World War II. According to the customs of the time, the underground railway had left-hand traffic.\n\n",

When the Mongols attacked the country and defeated King Béla IV's army, the king was forced to flee and leave the country. During his escape, he prayed to God to save him from the Tatars and offer his daughter Margaret in return. Due to miracles, the Mongols withdrew from Hungary and King Béla accepted his offer. He sent his daughter to a convent, then to the island of rabbits. Margaret wanted to build a religious city on the island, but she was soon taken by leprosy.\n\nNowadays Island is like a central park. In summer, it is always full of people.
