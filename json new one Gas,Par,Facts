            "content": "Who was Saint Stephen?\n\nSaint Stephen is the founding king who made Hungary a unified Christian country. His case is special because he personally dealt with the Hungarian pagans and killed his uncle Koppány, who wanted to take the throne from Stephen. The country celebrates the founding of the Christian homeland on August 20th every year with large events.\n\nWe often see statues with two rows of crosses, symbolizing that Hungary was separate from the Papal States and the Holy Roman Empire at that time.\n\n[IMAGE:saint_stephen]\n\nThe Basilica\n\n[IMAGE:basilica]\n\nSt. Stephen's Basilica is the largest church in Budapest. It was named after the king who united the Hungarians in Christianity. Construction started in 1851 and was completed in 1905—a total of 54 years.\n\nAfter Stephen's death, he was canonized, and by order of the Pope, his right hand was mummified as a relic. This hand, called the Holy Right Hand, is kept in the church and taken in a procession every August 20th.\n\n[IMAGE:holy_right_hand]\n\nThe central dome collapsed three times during construction, causing the deaths of three of the four lead architects. Today, it is one of the tallest buildings in Budapest (96m), equal in height to the Parliament. Built in Neo-Renaissance style.\n\nLiberty Square\n\n[IMAGE:liberty_square]\n\nLiberty Square is not an ordinary square. In the 1850s, it was home to the largest prison in Budapest. This prison housed soldiers, poets, and revolutionaries from the 1848-49 War of Independence.\n\nIn 1867, Austria and Hungary formed a personal union, allowing the Hungarian Minister to make some domestic policy decisions. The prison was dismantled, and all revolutionaries were freed.\n\n[IMAGE:old_prison]\n\nStock Exchange Palace\n\n[IMAGE:stock_exchange]\n\nThis building was constructed in 1902 as the Stock Exchange Palace but stopped functioning as such after World War II, when Hungary fell under Soviet control.\n\nIt was later used as the National Television Headquarters until 2006, when a political riot led to protesters storming the building and causing damage. Since then, it has remained empty, only occasionally used for film productions (e.g., Black Widow). Built in Late Eclecticism style.\n\nThe German Occupation Monument\n\n[IMAGE:german_monument]\n\nThis controversial monument has sparked political debates. It bears the inscription:\n\n\"IN MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION\"\n\nMany argue that this misrepresents history, as Hungary was one of the first countries to ally with Nazi Germany.\n\nThe Soviet Monument (End of the Square)\n\n[IMAGE:soviet_monument]\n\nAnother unpopular monument, as the inscription states:\n\n\"GLORY TO THE SOVIET SOLDIERS WHO LIBERATED HUNGARY.\"\n\nHowever, many Hungarians view Soviet rule as oppression rather than liberation.\n\nNearby, you can also find statues of two former US presidents: Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.\n\nThe Parliament\n\n[IMAGE:parliament]\n\nThe Budapest Parliament was built for Hungary's 1000th anniversary. All materials came from Hungary, and only Hungarian builders were allowed to work on it—hence why it's called \"The Country’s House.\"\n\nThe city has a law prohibiting buildings taller than the Parliament (96m), which is why there are no skyscrapers in central Budapest.\n\nThe Parliament has 691 rooms. Its architect, Imre Steindl, tragically went blind during construction, yet continued his work until his death just two weeks before the Parliament was completed in 1902.\n\nThe Flags at the Entrance\n\n[IMAGE:flags_parliament]\n\nThe flag on the left is that of Transylvania, which belonged to Hungary for over 1000 years before World War I.\n\nHungary had no choice but to enter WWI under the Austrian Emperor. After losing, 70% of Hungary’s land was taken away, displacing over 8 million Hungarians.\n\nStatues and Monuments at Parliament\n\nStatue of II. Ferenc Rákóczi\n\n[IMAGE:rakoczi_statue]\n\nLed the Kuruc rebellion against Austrian rule but was betrayed by the French King and exiled to Turkey.\n\nCount Gyula Andrássy\n\n[IMAGE:andrassy_statue]\n\nA leader in the 1848-49 War of Independence, later became Hungary’s Prime Minister.\n\nLajos Kossuth and His Political Party\n\n[IMAGE:kossuth_statue]\n\nA key figure in the 1848-49 War, later fled to America and joined the American Civil War.\n\nStatue of István Tisza\n\n[IMAGE:tisza_statue]\n\nHungary’s Prime Minister during WWI, opposed the war, but was assassinated by communist sympathizers after Hungary's defeat.\n\nThe Palace of Justice\n\n[IMAGE:palace_justice]\n\nBuilt in 1893, it was originally intended to be the Parliament. However, after finding out that the architect was Austrian, it was instead designated as the Palace of Justice.\n\nRiver Bank Shoes (Holocaust Memorial)\n\n[IMAGE:river_shoes]\n\nA tribute to the victims of the Holocaust. In 1944, as Germany was losing, the Hungarian Arrow Cross militia executed Jews along the Danube River by tying them together and shooting only one person, making the rest drown. There are 60 pairs of iron shoes at the site, unveiled on the 60th anniversary.\n\nThe Budapest Synagogue\n\n[IMAGE:synagogue]\n\nBuilt in 1859, this is the largest synagogue in Europe. It was a central part of the Budapest Ghetto, where 70,000 Jews were imprisoned in 1944.\n\nIn 1931, an assassin killed two worshippers, and in 1939, a grenade attack targeted the synagogue.",
