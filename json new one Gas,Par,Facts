            "content": "[IMAGE:saint_stephen]\n\nWho was Saint Stephen?\n\nSaint Stephen is the founding king who made Hungary a unified Christian country. His case is special because he personally dealt with the Hungarian pagans and killed his uncle Koppány, who wanted to take the throne from Stephen. The country celebrates the founding of the Christian homeland on August 20th every year with large events.\n\nWe often see statues with two rows of crosses, symbolizing that Hungary was separate from the Papal States and the Holy Roman Empire at that time.\n\nThe Basilica\n\n[IMAGE:basilica]\n\nSt. Stephen's Basilica is the largest church in Budapest. It was named after the king who united the Hungarians in Christianity. Construction started in 1851 and was completed in 1905—a total of 54 years.\n\nAfter Stephen's death, he was canonized, and by order of the Pope, his right hand was mummified as a relic. This hand, called the Holy Right Hand, is kept in the church and taken in a procession every August 20th.\n\n[IMAGE:holy_right_hand]\n\nOn the facade of the building there is a Latin sentence: EGO SUM VIA VERITAS ET VITA which means: I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE, this is what Jesus preached to his apostles. The Basilica was also built for the 1000th anniversary, but during its construction it took 4 builders to complete it, because the central dome collapsed three times and unfortunately three of the 4 builders died in the meantime. The only building that has the same height as the Parliament. (96m) Built in Neo-Renaissance style.\n\nLiberty Square\n\n[IMAGE:liberty_square]\n\nLiberty Square is not an ordinary square. Before it became a children's playground, in the 1850s there was a huge prison there, the largest in the city. The soldiers, poets and revolutionaries of the 1848-49 War of Independence were held in this prison. This did not last long, because in 1867 Austria and Hungary entered a personal union and the Hungarian Minister could decide on some things in domestic policy issues.\n\nOur Minister decided to dismantle the prison from the city centre and all revolutionaries were released.\n\n[IMAGE:old_prison]\n\nStock Exchange Palace\n\n[IMAGE:stock_exchange]\n\nThis building was constructed in 1902 as the Stock Exchange Palace but stopped functioning as such after World War II, when Hungary fell under Soviet control.\n\nIt was later used as the National Television Headquarters until 2006, when a political riot led to protesters storming the building and causing damage. Since then, it has remained empty, only occasionally used for film productions (e.g., Black Widow). Built in Late Eclecticism style.\n\nThe German Occupation Monument\n\n[IMAGE:german_monument]\n\nUnfortunately, this monument is not exactly the most popular, because what is written on it has caused a lot of political debate and disagreement among people. The text that is written there is: IN MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION.  Many people believe that this statement is a history falsification, because the Hungarian people were the first to happily join Nazi Germany.\n\n[IMAGE:soviet_monument]\n\nAnother unpopular monument, as the inscription states:\n\n\"GLORY TO THE SOVIET SOLDIERS WHO LIBERATED HUNGARY.\"\n\nHowever, many Hungarians view Soviet rule as oppression rather than liberation.\n\nNearby, you can also find statues of two former US presidents: Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.\n\nThe Parliament\n\n[IMAGE:parliament]\n\nThe Budapest Parliament was the main building built for the 1000th anniversary. All the materials, even the last piece of stone, came from Hungary, and the builders could only be Hungarians. That's why we call this building the country's house.\n\nThere is a rule in the city centre that states that there can be no building larger than the parliament. This is the reason why you don't see skyscrapers in the inner city.The height of the Parliament is 96 meters and only the Basilica reaches the same height, because it bears the name of St. Stephen.In Europe, this Parliament is only the third largest in terms of size, the second largest parliament in our country is the Westminster in London, and the largest is the Romanian Parliament in Bucharest.\n\nIn total, there are 691 rooms. The main architect Imre Steindl, hungarian architect, became blind in the middle of the construstion work, but still continued his job. The Parliament was finished in 1902, but Imre Steindl passed away two weeks before this date. Officially, it started operating in 1904.Built in neo-gothic, eclectic style.\n\nThe Flags at the Entrance\n\n[IMAGE:flags_parliament]\n\nThe flag on the left is the flag of Transylvania, it is there because until the First World War, Transylvania belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary for more than a thousand years. It is important to note that the Hungarians did not want to participate in the First World War, but since this did not depend on us but on the Austrian emperor, we did not have much choice. At the end of the war, Hungary received the greatest punishment, because the victorious countries decided to take 70% of its territories from Hungary. Partly because in terms of area and not in terms of population, there were more Romanians, Slovaks, Serbs, Austrians living in those territories than Hungarians.\n\nDue to the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary lost more than 8 million Hungarians to Russia. After all this, the Hungarians living in the ceded territories were kept in terror if they wanted to use the Hungarian language or culture.\n\nStatues and Monuments at Parliament\n\nAll the statues in front of the parliament were made between the 17th century and the 19th century.\n\nStatue of II. Ferenc Rákóczi\n\n[IMAGE:rakoczi_statue]\n\nFerenc Rákóczi was the leader of the Kuruc Labanc freedom struggle. Ferenc tried to prevent the Austrian takeover. During the wars, he had many successes, but he needed more soldiers and money. He went to the French King for help, but he betrayed him and handed Ferenc over to the Habsburgs. He had to live his life in exile and died in Turkey.\n\nCount Gyula Andrássy\n\n[IMAGE:andrassy_statue]\n\nAGyula fought in the 1848-49 War of Independence but was imprisoned when the country fell. 15 years later he got mercy from the Austrian Emperor and became Prime Minister of Hungary when the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy was established.\n\nLajos Kossuth and His Political Party\n\n[IMAGE:kossuth_statue]\n\nALajos Kossuth was a major leader during the 1848-49 War of Independence. After the fall of the homeland, he emigrated to America and continued his military career there during the civil wars. The statue was built after his death. Every Hungarian respected him and revolutionary songs about him are still taught in schools today.\n\nStatue of István Tisza\n\n[IMAGE:tisza_statue]\n\nHIstván Tisza was the Prime Minister of Hungary during World War I. He protested the Great War, but his efforts were in vain as the final decision was made by the Austrian Emperor. At the end of the war, some communist-sympathizing soldiers attacked him in his own house and executed him because he was blamed for the large territorial losses.\n\nThe Palace of Justice\n\n[IMAGE:palace_justice]\n\nThis building was built in 1893 and its builders hoped that this building would become the parliament. Since we would have two parliaments, the members of the Hungarian architectural committee started a vote to decide which one should be the parliament. Before they voted, they inspected the building, and the members of the Hungarian committee found a flaw in the building. The builder of the building was Austrian and therefore it could not be a parliament, but the Palace of Justice. Built in eclectic style.\n\nMinistry of Agriculture (in front of parliament)\n\n[IMAGE:agricultura]\n\nIn Soviet times, it was the headquarters of the Communist political party. It was from this building that members of the secret political police (ÁVH) fired on a peaceful protesting crowd in 1956.\n\nRiver Bank Shoes (Holocaust Memorial)\n\n[IMAGE:river_shoes]\n\nIron Shoes on the Danube Bank is a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. In 1944, the German and Hungarian forces were clearly losing. As the Nazis reached the Hungarian borders, they shot up all the railway lines that went in and out of the country.\n\nThis meant that the transport of people of Jewish origin to the concentration camp became impossible\n\nSince the Hungarian Arrow Cross militia had to make a quick decision, they decided to carry out the executions on the embankment. Since this is a rather difficult topic, we will not go into more detailed information, but it should be clarified that during the Holocaust, not only Jews were executed, but also Gypsies and gays. The Arrow Cross used particularly cruel methods during the executions. Sometimes, citing the need to save ammunition, they would shoot one person from a family, but their feet would be tied together with the rest of the family. A total of 60 pairs of shoes can be seen there, as the monument was unveiled on the 60th anniversary of the events.\n\nThe Budapest Synagogue\n\n[IMAGE:synagogue]\n\nThis synagogue was completed in 1859. Interestingly, it was the fastest built of all the attractions in Budapest. Despite its size, the building was completed in 5 years. Many Jews still live around the synagogue today and preserve the traditions of their religion. This synagogue is the largest synagogue in Europe.\n\nIn the spring of 1931, two worshippers were killed by a revolver-wielding assassin, and on February 3, 1939, a hand grenade was thrown from the roof of the house opposite into the crowd leaving the service. Finally, in 1944, the Budapest ghetto was established here: one of its gates was on the Wesselényi Street side of the arcade. Nearly seventy thousand people were crowded together,in the blocks of houses behind it and in the synagogue itself, deprived of their property and rights, and subjected to constant fear of death.",
